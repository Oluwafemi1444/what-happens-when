What happens when...
====================
A brief explanation of what happens when you type
a URL into a web browser
When you type a URL like “https://www.google.com” into a web
browser and hit enter key, there are a lot of things that go on before
you finally get some output on your browser.
Fortunately, all these things happen in a split second, so you hardly
ever stop to think about them. Before I take the individual steps
involved and explain them in detail, let me give you a general
overview of everything that goes on within those few microseconds.
1. Your computer sends a request to the domain name system
(DNS)
Server which serves as an address book for all domain names.
This then sends back the exact IP address of the server which
https://www.google.com points to.
2. Knowing this IP, your computer then establishes a connection
with the server through the IP address. The type of this
connection is known as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
and your computer is able to establish this connection
through the Internet Protocol (IP). This whole process is
known as a “handshake
